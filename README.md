## Homework 1:ScroogeCoin  
* In this homework, I have implemented the ScroogeCoin, where the central authority Scrooge receives transactions from users.  In each block, Scrooge will receive a list of transactions, validate the transactions he receives, and publish a list of validated transactions.  
* The homework is uploaded to *Homework1_ScroogeCoin*.   


## Homework 2:Block Chain  
* In this homework, I have implemented a node that’s part of a block-chain-based distributed consensus protocol. My code would receive incoming transactions and blocks and maintain an updated block chain under some assumptions.
* The homework is uploaded to *Homework2_BlockChain*.


## DApp:A Charity System Based on Ethereum
* In this project, we will use Ethereum to build a decentralized autonomous charity where donors can trace their money from the moment it is given, to the moment it will be spent.
* The proposal is uploaded to *Project*.
